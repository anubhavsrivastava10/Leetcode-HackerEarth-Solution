# REST API and POSTMAN

### What is REST? 
Representaional State Transfer describes an architeactural style for web Services.
REST consists of a set of standards or constraints for sharing data between different
systems and systems that implement REST are known as RESTful.

### What is API? 
is an Application Programming Interface which is ann interface that allows software
programs to communicate with eachother.

### What is RESTful API ?
is simply an API that adheres to the principles and constraints of REST.
A server receives a request through a URL endpoint and sends a response whuch is often 
data in a JSON format.
### Guiding constraints define the REST architecture 

**Uniform Interface**: The interface of components must be the same. This means using the 
URI standard to identify resources—in other words, paths that could be entered into the 
browser's location bar.

**Client-Server**: There is a separation of concerns between the server, which stores and 
manipulates data, and the client, which requests and displays the response.

**Stateless Interactions**: All information about each request is contained in each individual
request and does not depend on session state.

**Cacheable**: The client and server can cache resources.

**Layered System**: The client can be connected to the end server, or an intermediate layer such
as a load-balancer.

**Code on Demand** (Optional): A client can download code, which reduces visibility from the outside.

### HTTP and HTTP Methods
HTTP is the method of communication between the client and the server
When you go to a URL on the web, you are actually doing a GET request on that specific resource, 
and the website you see is the body of the response.
HTTP works by opening a TCP connection to a server port (80 for http, 443 for https) to make a request, and the
listening server responds with a status and a body.

_**A request must consist of a URL, a method, header information, and a body.**_

#### HTTP request methods loosely correspond to the paradigm of CRUD, which stands for Create, Update, Read, Delete.

Operation | Command | Description | Success Code
----------|---------|-------------|-------------
READ | GET | Retrieves a resource | 200(OK)
CREATE | POST | Creates a new resource | 201(CREATED)
UPDATE | PUT | Update an existing resource | 200(OK)
DELETE | DELETE | Delete a rosource | 200(OK), 202(ACCEPTED), 204(NO CONTENT)

#### Five Status code that each contain a range of response

Code | Meaning
-----|--------
1xx | Information
2xx | Success
3xx | Redirection
4xx | Client Error
5xx | Server Error

#### For Postman API practice goto
